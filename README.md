# Fake News Detection

This Repository is from my final year project which was 'Fake News Detection'

This project was very open-ended, so I decided to use a Kaggle dataset and assume this dataset was correct. I understand this data has its own bias and therefore a massive area for improvement for this project would be to create my own dataset of news articles that are genuine and fake. 

The end goal of this project was to create a strong pre-processing stage of the data and focus on optimising the Machine Learning algorithms to classify the text data. 

This project focused on 
-TFIDF
-Word Embeddings
